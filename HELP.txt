// here we made an auth change
1. in config/auth

paste this file in first codes 
           
 'admin' => [
                'driver' => 'session',
                'provider' => 'admins',
            ],

2. in user providers in config/auth
paste this file after the providers code

 'admins' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => App\AdminUser::class,
        ],

3. As we know we are working on a ecommerce website so we need a option of shoppingcart
for that
we have to install some more packages, i.e.
composer require hardevine/shoppingcart
